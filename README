### DESCRIPTION

This project tends to provide a google extension that can help 
people to recognize their use of Personally Identifiable 
Information (PII) from the web browser, google chrome. 

This extension will capture the PII that is submitted to any 
web server during sign up or login process and store them 
into the google sync storage. When the users want to check their 
history of using websites, they can see them by simply clicking 
the small icon on the right side of address area of the google 
chrome and then selecting any button we provide.

This extension currently provides three functions: signed-ups, web 
access hisotry, and suspcious activities.
First, signed-ups show the websites that the users register or visit 
for the first time. With this, anyone can manage their records of 
registered websites easily.
Second, web access history is a kind of raw data of our program. 
It basically shows every activities that users send their PII to 
the web server our from their local computer. 
Third, suspcious activities is the personal information usage history
that is suspected as malicious behavior. This is an experimental and 
optional function currently. Users can set the threshold for both of 
suspicous and warning activities on the settings pages. This fucntion 
currently works based on the values. It will be improved by a reason-
able method afterwards.

* Please note that this application is NOT STABLE version. Installing 
and using this application might slow your web browser currently.
